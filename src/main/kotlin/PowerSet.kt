/**
 * Note for the reviewers: this can be done with recursion, and I've tried to implement it with success, not without
 * assistance from dear Google to do so, however, as I recognize I am not the most proficient user of recursive
 * functions.
 * In turn, I chose an iterative approach of my own doing. I'm certain this is not efficient at all, roughly looking
 * it can go as high as O(n^3) taking a look into the drop implementation. I'm sure this can be improved and iterated
 * upon, but I'm not seeing a better solution currently besides recursion which, as said previously, my brain has a
 * hard time implementing on its own ðŸ§ª
